- Common testing harness for the C code and the racket code.
- Test harness is going to be simple.  Executable that just runs
  the test cases (and groups them).
- Each testing module is an executable, one testing module per "component"
  output from tests is #tests passed/#total, possibly description (standard error)

Environment Modifications:
  Should probably have functions that setup a test Seashell development
  environment for our test scripts.  This will probably require modifying
  the Seashell configuration system.  (seashell-config.rkt.in)

Components to test:
  WebSockets - make sure we can send/receive messages using the WebSockets code
               in the repository.  Should be able to launch a listener, a client,
               and send/receive messages.
  Project / File Management -  Testing files and directories are correctly setup,
               Contents are properly written out.
  Cryptography code - Really should test integrity verification and encrypting/decrypting.
  Compiler - Test can produce valid executables from source files.
