          <dt>How does Seashell's version control work?</dt>
          <dd>
          <p>
          As Seashell is browser-based and internet connections aren't
          always reliable, Seashell automatically saves the text in the
          editor to your account on the school machines once every ten
          seconds or so, so any unexpected crashes won't hurt you too much.
          </p>

          <p>
          This removes your ability to get rid of unwanted changes by
          closing a file with unsaved modifications however. Seashell's
          version control lets you have the best of both worlds by
          allowing you to commit and revert files.
          </p>

          <p>
          Seashell's version control uses git in the backend.
          The user interface currently only understands how to commit and
          revert to the last commit, but git proper lets you do much,
          much more than that! You can learn more about git
          <a href="http://git-scm.com/">here</a>.
          </p>
          </dd>

          <dt>What's a commit?</dt>
          <dd>
          <p>
          Commits are a way to make "snapshots" of your files
          <strike>that you can move back and forth between</strike>.
          For example, you may wish to commit before you make
          potentially code-breaking changes to a function.
          </p>
          </dd>

          <dt>What does revert do?</dt>
          <dd>
          <p>
          Revert irreversibly destroys all changes you've made in the current
          file since your last commit. You will be asked to confirm
          that you actually do want to revert a file, but you should
          still be careful with this feature.
